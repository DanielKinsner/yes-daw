# YES DAW — STATUS (live handoff)

**Read this first on any machine.** This is the single source of truth for *where we are right now*.
The [plan](docs/plans/2026-06-23-feat-yes-daw-architecture-roadmap-plan.md) and
[roadmap](docs/goals/roadmap.md) are the stable reference; **this** file is the live, constantly-updated
worklog.

> **Cross-machine rule:** `git pull` at the start of a session. At the end, update this file, commit in
> small chunks, and `git push`. Then the next machine — or the next session — is never lost.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-23
**Current horizon:** **H0 (spikes)** — in progress

> **Verification = CI.** A change is done when CI is green, not when Dan listens or watches. The only
> human step is blessing a golden on an intended audio change (`cmake --build build --target bless-goldens`).

## Now — the one small task in flight
- **Verification is now mechanical and green.** CI (Windows + Linux + macOS) builds the app and runs a
  headless Catch2 self-check (golden + 440 Hz pitch + level + purity + fade + perf); an RTSan leg
  proves the audio hot path never allocates/locks; a real-machine `tools/soak.sh` is the H0 exit gate.
  An adversarial review found two gate holes (golden blind to steady-state; asymmetric distortion
  passed) — both closed and proven. **All three H0 spikes de-risked on the CI side:** #1 WAV scrub
  (full), #2 timeline CPU cost (0.007 ms/frame for 5000 clips), #3 node block-size-independence. The
  soak PASSED on the owner's machine. **Remaining for H0 (real-hardware/GUI):** a native GPU render
  shell + `max_frame_ms` in the soak, then the 10-min soak run = H0 exit.

## Current-horizon checklist — H0 (plain English, small steps)
- [x] Install the C++ toolchain (CMake + MSVC via VS 2022 Build Tools). ✓
- [x] `cmake -B build` configures and fetches JUCE with no error. ✓
- [x] App builds and a window opens (`YesDaw.exe`). ✓ — *`Main.cpp` compiled clean first try.*
- [x] A 440 Hz tone plays out real hardware (spike #1: device round-trip core). ✓
- [x] **Stand up CI + a self-asserting check harness** ✓ — GitHub Actions (Win+Linux+mac) via the `ci`
  preset builds + runs Catch2 `YesDawCheck` (golden + Goertzel/zero-crossing 440 Hz + RMS/peak/symmetry/
  DC purity + fade + perf); RTSan leg (`-fsanitize=realtime`, Clang 20) enforces no-alloc on the hot
  path; warnings-as-errors; `bless-goldens`. Recorded in ADR-0005. *(green; see `docs/ci-mechanical-verification.md`)*
- [x] Tame the spike (fade-in / lower level) ✓ — 50 ms fade-in + `noteOn/noteOff` in `SineSource`,
  −20 dBFS default; asserted by the fade-in check. *(start-stop UI deferred — spike.)*
- [x] Real-machine soak harness built ✓ — `YesDawSoak` opens the real device, counts xruns/deadline-
  misses → PASS/FAIL; now enforces the **128-frame** target (`--block-size`, the roadmap stress case)
  and, with `--loopback`, that the captured tone is actually **440 Hz**. Run with `tools/soak.ps1`
  (native Windows, no Git Bash) or `tools/soak.sh`. Audio is clean (0 dropouts) on the owner's box, but
  the 128-frame target needs a **low-latency driver** (ASIO/WASAPI-exclusive — shared-mode Realtek
  forces 480). **Owner runs the 10-min gate; loopback needs an out→in jumper.**
- [x] Load + scrub one WAV ✓ — `YesDawAssetCheck` decodes a committed fixture WAV, golden-diffs the
  440 Hz sine (≤1e-4), recovers pitch (zero-crossings), and scrubs (sub-range read == slice, bit-
  identical). CI green on Win/Linux/mac. *(spike #1 complete)*
- [~] GPU timeline 100+ elements at 60fps (spike #2) — **CPU half done + green**: pure viewport
  virtualization (`src/ui/TimelineLayout.h`, `YesDawUiCheck`) lays out a 5000-clip viewport in
  **0.0069 ms/frame** (~2400× under the 16.6 ms budget), so the whole frame is the GPU's. *Remaining
  (real-hardware): a native GPU render shell + `max_frame_ms<16.6` in the soak (NOT yet implemented).*
  Native is the chosen direction (plan-recommended + this spike's cost validation); the formal UI-stack
  ADR (fork #2) is written at H1 — until then "native" is a strong lean, not a locked ADR.
- [x] One Node behind a stub of the format-neutral trait (spike #3) ✓ — `YesDawEngineCheck` drives a
  `ToneNode` via the trait at block sizes 1/31/128/512/4096/9000 → bit-identical output, finite, no
  denormals. *(throwaway stub; the real Node contract is frozen at H1.)*
- [ ] **Exit = two soak gates on a real machine** (no human judgment):
  - **(a) audio — IMPLEMENTED:** `soak.sh`/`soak.ps1` exits 0 with `xruns==0`, `deadline_misses==0`,
    `block_size<=128`, and (with `--loopback`) RMS>0.01 dominated by 440 Hz.
  - **(b) GPU 60 fps — NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:** `max_frame_ms<16.6` requires the native render shell that
    doesn't exist yet, so the soak does NOT check it — a soak PASS today is the AUDIO gate only.
  H0 is done when both are green on one machine at a 128-frame Block.

## Done recently
- 2026-06-23 — **Foundation** committed: research corpus, CONTEXT glossary, ADR-0001/0002, roadmap, CLAUDE.md.
- 2026-06-23 — **Brainstorm**: direction locked — full general-purpose DAW; C++/JUCE + our own engine;
  audio + MIDI co-equal; linear timeline; editing-first; long-horizon.
- 2026-06-23 — **Plan** written; ADR-0003 (product) + ADR-0004 (stack); roadmap rebuilt; docs reconciled.
- 2026-06-23 — **Deepen-plan** applied: deepening-notes companion; loops section; decision #14
  (sample-rate); 10 simplifications adopted (8 scope-cuts rejected — full scope kept); housekeeping.
- 2026-06-23 — **Loop workflow adopted in full**; **3 H1 conflicts resolved** (15360-tick grid /
  128-bit ULID / out-of-process hosting).
- 2026-06-23 — **Codex plan review applied** (all 7 findings, no scope cut): made the snapshot /
  state-ownership / graph-publication model exact; promoted bundle crash-recovery into H1's gate;
  fleshed the out-of-process host runtime + isolation gate; PDC test now covers automation + events;
  sample-rate → H1 + automation-curve added as decision #15; fixed stale docs (adr/README, CLAUDE.md).
- 2026-06-23 — **Codex review round 2 applied:** plugin-IPC nonblocking contract (audio thread never
  waits on a child — one-block pipeline + fail-open); per-run state arenas (RT vs offline never share
  state); fixed persistence contradiction; H1 recovery gate = save/migration (import-kill → H2);
  marked resolved conflicts historical.
- 2026-06-23 — **H0 kickoff:** committed CMake + JUCE scaffold + sine spike (`src/Main.cpp`), `AGENT.md`,
  `.gitignore`. Unverified until the toolchain is installed and it's built.
- 2026-06-23 — **H0 spike #1 core WORKING:** toolchain in (MSVC 19.44 / CMake), JUCE fetched + built,
  `Main.cpp` compiled clean **first try**, `YesDaw.exe` plays a 440 Hz sine out real hardware. Full
  stack proven end-to-end.
- 2026-06-23 — **Mechanical-first model + CI cheat-sheet** committed (`docs/ci-mechanical-verification.md`)
  + `bootstrap/windows.ps1` (idempotent one-command toolchain install; fixes the winget-quoting pain).
  Standing up CI is the agent's first H0 task. Commit rule: frequent, straight to main, no squash.
- 2026-06-23 — **CI + harness LIVE and GREEN** (the first H0 task, done in full): extracted a pure
  `SineSource` from the spike; Catch2 `YesDawCheck` (golden + pitch + level + purity + fade + perf);
  GitHub Actions 3-OS matrix via the `ci` preset; warnings-as-errors (SYSTEM-demoted deps); RTSan leg;
  `bless-goldens`; ADR-0005. An **adversarial multi-agent review** caught + closed two real gate holes
  (golden window inside the fade; asymmetric distortion passing) — both proven via injected-bug tests.
  Built the **real-machine soak** (`tools/soak.sh` + `YesDawSoak`); verified on this box.

## Next
- ✅ **Agentic-loop workflow: adopted in full** (activates at H1).
- ✅ **3 architecture conflicts resolved** (2026-06-23): time = **15360**-tick grid · stable IDs =
  **128-bit ULID** · plugin hosting = **out-of-process / sandboxed** from the start.
- **Begin H0 spikes** (next build step): device round-trip, 60fps GPU timeline, one Node behind the trait stub.

## Blocked / open threads
- Engine concurrency model (plan's *Threading & the real-time boundary* + *The graph* sections) is out
  for a **Codex re-verify** pass. H0 does not depend on it, so H0 proceeds in parallel.
